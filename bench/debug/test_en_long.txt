***Princess Mononoke*** [^1] is a 1997 Japanese animated [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama "Historical drama") [fantasy film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_film "Fantasy film") written and directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki "Hayao Miyazaki"). Set in the [Muromachi period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muromachi_period "Muromachi period") of Japanese history, the film follows Ashitaka, a young [Emishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emishi "Emishi") prince who journeys west to cure his cursed arm and becomes embroiled in the conflict between Irontown and the forest of the gods, as well as the feud between Lady Eboshi and a human girl raised by wolves named San. Produced by [Toshio Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshio_Suzuki "Toshio Suzuki"), animated by [Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli "Studio Ghibli"), and distributed by [Toho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toho "Toho"), it stars the voices of [Yōji Matsuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dji_Matsuda "Yōji Matsuda"), [Yuriko Ishida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuriko_Ishida "Yuriko Ishida"), [Yūko Tanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABko_Tanaka "Yūko Tanaka"), [Kaoru Kobayashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoru_Kobayashi_\(actor\) "Kaoru Kobayashi (actor)"), [Masahiko Nishimura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiko_Nishimura "Masahiko Nishimura"), [Tsunehiko Kamijō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunehiko_Kamij%C5%8D "Tsunehiko Kamijō"), [Akihiro Miwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiro_Miwa "Akihiro Miwa"), [Mitsuko Mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuko_Mori "Mitsuko Mori"), and [Hisaya Morishige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisaya_Morishige "Hisaya Morishige").

Miyazaki began developing early concepts in 1980 and later considered basing a film on the Japanese literary classic the *[Hōjōki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dj%C5%8Dki "Hōjōki")* (1212); elements of both evolved substantially into the eventual film. After taking a break to direct *[On Your Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Your_Mark "On Your Mark")* (1995), he led the production with a budget of ¥2.35 billion, making it the most expensive animated film at the time. Some [computer-generated imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery "Computer-generated imagery") and other digital techniques were used in conjunction with [hand-drawn animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-drawn_animation "Hand-drawn animation"), a first for Miyazaki. The film explores themes of [environmentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism "Environmentalism") and societal diversity, partly inspired by Miyazaki's readings into novel historical and cultural studies, and presents a [feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist "Feminist") portrayal of its characters. It also blends fantastical elements with its depiction of medieval Japanese history, influenced by the *[jidaigeki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jidaigeki "Jidaigeki")* style. The score was composed by [Joe Hisaishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hisaishi "Joe Hisaishi"), a longtime collaborator of Miyazaki's.

*Princess Mononoke* was theatrically released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and broke several box office records. Suzuki led the film's marketing, then the largest advertisement campaign in Japan. It eventually became the [highest-grossing film in the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_Japan "List of highest-grossing films in Japan"). Following a distribution deal struck between [Tokuma Shoten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokuma_Shoten "Tokuma Shoten") and [Walt Disney Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_\(division\) "Walt Disney Studios (division)"), it was the first of Studio Ghibli's films to be released internationally and was given to [Miramax Films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax_Films "Miramax Films") to be dubbed into English and distributed in North America. [Neil Gaiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman "Neil Gaiman") wrote the translation, making significant alterations for its American audience; the dub underperformed at the box office. As of 2025, the film has grossed US$212.2 million through various theatrical and home media releases. It received a broadly positive critical response in both Japan and the United States and earned a number of major Japanese accolades, including top awards at the [Mainichi Film Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainichi_Film_Awards "Mainichi Film Awards") and the [Japan Academy Film Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Academy_Film_Prize "Japan Academy Film Prize"). Its sustained popularity and cultural impact have since made it a [cult film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film "Cult film").
